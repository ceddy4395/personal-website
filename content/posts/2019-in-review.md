*It has been a year full of ups and downs and on a whole variety of boats, ranging from the 6.5m long J22 to the 20+m 
long VO65. In between these two there was some die hard racing onboard the J111 as well as the Karma Sailing team. 
Not every event went as expected, but at the end of the year it still feels like I have achieved something big during 2019.*

## J22  
To start of with the smallest boat of the year. Late 2018, a couple of friends and I decided to start sailing the J22's again. In January 2019 it was finally time to start, after signing the contract to use the boat for 1 year we were able to get some good training in. Unfortunately, our first ever race in March 2019 got cancelled due to too much wind. We still had to wait a little before we could finally test ourselves against the others.    
Then in May, the North Sea Regatta finally came around, after again one day being cancelled because of the stormy weather. 
We were able to get 2 days of racing in the books. A lot of lessons learned and time to get some more training in before 
the Worlds in Warnemunde at the beginning of July. Unfortunately, time was not at our hands, with a lot of boat repair to be done to fix the keel. 
<img src="/uploads/2019-in-review/j22-schade.jpeg" width="300" align="right"></img> We only had limited hours left to train on the water.  
When July came around it was time to leave for Warnemunde, upon arriving the keel was unfortionatly not finished and therefore missed 
the first race of the pre-world. The next day there was too much wind to sail and thus all races got cancelled. 
The Worldchampionship was one with either too much wind or too little therefore we were only able to sail two days out of 
the four. We ended the worlds in 15th, a little disappointing result but with a lot of lessons learned! Now its time for 
me to say goodbye to the team and wish them good luck for the upcoming season! <img src="/uploads/2019-in-review/j22.jpeg" width="300"></img>


## Red Herring

With the Red Herring we also had a bit of an up and down season racing on the Solent. Occasionally winning regatta's very confidently but other 
times not being able to get close to the podium. This year's goal was to learn as much as possible, with a new driver and trimmers. 
We realized we are very strong in the light breeze, winning almost every regatta, whilst in the stronger breeze we have some work to do for next year. 
I'm definitely looking forward to continuing next season with as highlight the World Championship in Cowes.

## Copa Del Rey
This year was my first *Copa Del Rey* together with the family De Ridder on their X-37, Checkmate. It was a beautiful event
with an amazingly high level of competition. This year they introduced a new racing format. <img src="/uploads/2019-in-review/copa-del-rey.jpeg" align="left" width='300' style="margin:10px;"></img>
The first three days of racing were counted as one race. This means that, when we started the final two days, almost 
everybody got a re-start since everybody was 
just 1 point away from each other. This opened up the door for us, after a little somber qualification series we started the finals 
in 15th place. After a very good first day of the finals, we were able to climb into 9th overnight. A place we were going to 
defend hard on the final day of racing. Unfortionatly, we pushed to much and found ourselves over the start line early and had 
to return. Giving the fact that there were no discards in the finals we fell back to 15th place overall finishing the event. 
Sailing in the bay of Palma is beautiful with an amazing level of sailors, definitely trying to be back next year!

## VO65
To end of the season, I got a call from the [Austrian Ocean Race Project](https://www.facebook.com/TheAustrianOceanRaceProject/) 
to join them on their trip from Malta to Valencia. After saying 'yes' without hesitations I was quickly on an airplane <img src="/uploads/2019-in-review/vo65-winch.jpeg" align='right' width='200' style="margin:10px"></img>
down to Malta in order to join the boat and do some last minute maintenance. 
After everything was finished and everybody was on board, we left Malta at 9PM. We spend 4 days sailing upwind in very typical 
mediterranean weather. During the night we very often ran into pitch-black thunderstorms and winds picking up to 40kn. During
the day we had fantastic sailing weather, it was nice and warm with winds varying between 10-20KN.

All in all, bouncing up and down upwind with such a Carbon beast can be rough, it's very loud inside and it's difficult 
to get sleep occasionally but it was an amazing experience nonetheless and I'm definitely looking forward to getting the 
change to spend more time onboard the VO65's.

2019 has been an awesome year with a lot of new experiences. I'm looking forward to next year with a couple of new opportunities 
lined up such as the Melges 32!

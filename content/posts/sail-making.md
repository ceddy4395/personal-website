*I've been interested in sails and sail trim for almost as long as I sail. Now I got the opportunity to finally design
 and create my own set of sails for a project at [TU Delft university](www.tudelft.nl) for my minor in Sailing Yachts. 
 I'll take you through the things I've learned designing and creating these sails from scratch!*

## 1. Sail analysis and sail shape
Whilst I was working on the design of the sail which I build, I used a tool called: [SailPack Vision](https://www.onesails.com/nl/sailpack-vision/) by [OneSails](https://www.onesails.com/nl/?___from_store=international). It's a 
tool which is used by many sail-makers and professional sailing teams to analyze their sail shape and to verify it to 
the original design. For this project I took a number of pictures of the jib and mainsail from onboard the J111-Red Herring
and pulled them through the program. This gave me an indication of the sail shapes I should be looking for in my design.
<br></br>
Looking at these pictures it was clear to see what a difference in halyard tension, backstay tension, etc made to the shape 
of the sail, moving the deepest part of the sail (camber) forwards and aft, or opening up the leech to create more twist. 
One of these pictures can be seen below!

After having an idea about the sail shape I wanted I was able to input this into Sailcut 3D, a program in which you can 
insert camber placement, luff-, leech-, foot-length, etc. and designs the panels for you. 
 On the right you can see the I used to 
create the jib showcased below. For those who didn't know yet 
how sails got their original shape, this will be an eyeopener. The way this works is by gluing a curved line onto a 
straight line and thus curving the whole cloth. Keep in mind that these margins are very small as sail-makers are usually working
with curves which vary only millimeters. 

## 2. Learning to working with sails
Being able to work with sails and sail cloth is a very handy skill to have. I'm sure that everybody has ripped a 
sail so big that some tape didn't fix it at least once in their life. Wouldn't it be great if you knew how to repair this 
yourself? This is a skill that will definitely come in handy on long passages where things always break. In this case, all 
you would need is some spare sailcloth, 3M double-sided tape and a sowing machine. Much easier to take with you then a whole 
spare inventory of sails. 
<br></br>
Working on creating these sails has taught me skills which will eventually also come in handy when having to do sail repair. 
Ofcourse, these sails will not be perfect, but they will get the job done, and be better than nothing! Being able to 
apply the double-sided tape and the new sailcloth very precisely is a must for a clean repair! Working on these sails 
was most certainly a good practice for these skills and I'm starting to get more confident to do sail repairs in the future.       
Have a look at the main & jib I've made, I cut the pieces by hand (causing for a lot of inaccuracies compared to modern methods of creating panels) 
and then taped them on trying to be as accurate as possible to follow the curves of the panels.

## 3. Appreciation for the skill of the sail-makers 
Although most of the sails are now designed and cut by software, the actual gluing and sticking of the sails is still 
very often done by hand. To get a sail perfect to the designed shape requires a lot precision when gluing the panels together. 
Sailmaking is really an art and not something you'll be good at straight away. It is something that requires a lot of practice 
and failure before you can be very good at it. Whilst creating my first sail I really started to appreciate the skills 
sailmakers have to create such a precise sail as well as making nearly perfect repairs. 

## Final result
Below is a video of the final result of the sails finally sailing after also building the boat at the TU Delft.
